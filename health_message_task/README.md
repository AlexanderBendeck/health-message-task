# Using Neuroscience to Optimize Digital Health Interventions across Adulthood (2018-2019)

## Background
Most people know that being more physically active is good for them, but many still don’t do it. While clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of exercise programs for enhancing cognition and well-being in older age, a persistent challenge is how to motivate aging adults to engage in physical activity in their daily lives. Recent neuroscientific and psychological research shows that motivation changes with age. Older adults are more motivated by social rewards and pay more attention to and better remember positively-framed messages relative to negatively-framed ones. Thus, positively-framed social rewards may provide critical incentives for aging adults to engage in physical activity.

## Project Description
The goal of this Bass Connections project is to combine approaches from neuroscience, psychology and global health to identify ways to individually motivate adults to become more physically active in daily life.

The project will test the hypothesis that positively-framed social rewards will motivate aging adults’ to more frequently engage in physical activity in daily life. In a community sample of healthy adults ages 30-80, the team will use human brain imaging (fMRI) to assess the sensitivity of motivational brain systems (e.g., striatum and medial prefrontal cortex) to socioemotionally-framed health messages. After neuroimaging, participants will have their activity continuously monitored for three months while receiving physical activity promotion messages on their mobile phones in the form of programmed voice-over IP and text messages, developed in partnership with the Duke Global Digital Health Science Center. Team members will use the neural measures as predictors of the effectiveness of specific messages delivered via mobile phone to increase activity in daily life.

## Anticipated Outcomes
Publication of findings; data, code and experimental stimuli made publicly available through OSF; application for large multidisciplinary federal grant; development of a personalized mobile digital physical activity promotion program that can target aging adults across diverse communities in the local geographical area and beyond
